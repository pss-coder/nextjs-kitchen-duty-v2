## Purpose

Living in Lappis Student Accomodation F10 (Sweden, Stockholm) over a year, my floor constantly uses manual paper to track/display duties to assign. With Roster Planning, manual assignment is no longer needed.

## How it works

1. Start by checking room numbers to assign duty.
2. Followed by inputting # of weeks to generate roster.
3. Save as PDF.
